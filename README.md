### Goal: To develop a POC using Flask, HTML and CSS for predicting whether a person is suffering from Heart Diesease or not, implementing Machine Learning algorithm.

Heart disease affects millions of people, and it remains the cause of death in the world. Medical diagnosis should be proficient, reliable, and aided with computer techniques to reduce the effective cost for diagnostic tests. This project paper uses Decision Tree techniques to predict heart disease.Then we will  save the Decision Tree model as a pickle file using pickle library to reuse it again for the Deployment purpose and build a web app using Flask and HTML.

# Deployment Architecture:
The backend part of the application was made using Flask and for the frotend part HTML and CSS was used.The file "app.py" contains the entire flask code and inside the templates folder, "new.html" contains the homepage and "result.html" contains the result page.

# Glimpse of the application:
